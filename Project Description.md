Topical analysis of curricula in undergraduate degree programmes
Dr. Peter Mooney & Graham Keane

Proposed Project Details

How do we compare the subject matter or topics which students are taught in undergraduate or 
postgraduate courses in Computer Science? How comparable are the syllabi of two undergraduate 
degree programmes in Computer Science from two different universities in the same country or 
in different countries? For example, does University X introduce students to a topic P in 2nd 
year while University Y introduces a similar topic to students in 4th year? In this project, 
the successful candidate will design and develop a suitable database to store and manage the 
course syllabus information for Computer Science undergraduate programmes. Using a mixture of 
automated methods and manual tagging the subjects and topics for each syllabus will be stored 
in the database. Information about courses and course content will be taken from publicly 
available web resources from Universities (initially in Ireland but then beyond Ireland). 
The student will develop some means of querying and visualising the data and information stored
in this database. Visualisations would include answering questions such as: “Display a comparison 
of the syllabus from MU and UCD in undergraduate computer science” or “Display the most popular 
subjects or topics across all programmes”. The types of technologies used will include (but is 
not limited to): databases, natural language processing, topic modelling, visualisation. 
The project offers the successful student an exciting opportunity to work with a number of 
technologies which will be very beneficial to their own learning and skills development and 
significantly enhance their own personal CV. The project should be developed in a flexible and 
extendable way. With some minor adjustments the concept behind this project could be applied to 
other subjects such as Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, etc.

Role of the SPUR Student

The successful SPUR student will fulfil a number of roles in this project. They will be the sole
software engineer and software developer for the application software. They will also
undertake their own independent research (guided by the supervisor) into similar applications
already available and the best data models or database structures in which to store this
information. Given the student’s role as the primary engineer and developer on the project
this will be particularly suitable for students who are interested in design and development of
which supports research.
As this project is designed as a small software development project the student will be able to
experience the entire process of software development until final delivery of the project at the
end of the SPUR programme.

Benefits to the SPUR Student
There are many benefits to the SPUR student. These include (but are not limited to) the
following:
• Supervision by a very experienced research mentor and teacher who has successfully
supervised SPUR projects in the past.
• An opportunity to work independently and bring forth new ideas and solutions for the
research problem above.
• An opportunity to work on a new research problem or question which could eventually
be beneficial in discussions and planning around curriculum development, subject
choice, etc.
• Potential to be involved in an academic paper publication at the end of the SPUR project
which will detail the findings of this research work. This would be particularly beneficial
to the student’s resume.
• An opportunity to learn new software technologies or indeed extend and expand current
skills and knowledge in these technologies.
• To get a taste of the world of university research and through the SPUR programme
experience in dissemination of knowledge and outputs to a wider audience.
